ðŸ“° Context-Aware Newspaper Article Generator
This project leverages RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) and LangChain technologies to build a context-aware newspaper article generator.

I implemented the functionality where users can upload documents containing relevant information to be included in the generated article. The tool processes these documents and uses them as context to generate a brief, coherent newspaper-style article consisting of three paragraphs with a catchy headline.

Once the article is generated, users have the option to either copy the content directly or download it as a text file for future use.
